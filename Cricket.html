                AUS vs IND World Cup 2023 Final highlights: Australia won a record-extending sixth 50-overs World Cup title after opener Travis Head smashed a magnificent century to fashion their six-wicket victory in Sunday's final against the tournament's form team India.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Put into bat, India rode battling half-centuries by KL Rahul and Virat Kohli to post a below-par 240 all out in exactly 50 overs at a packed Narendra Modi Stadium.
            </p>
                <p>Australia suffered a top order wobble of their own but Head's 137 off 120 balls saw them romp home with seven overs to spare in match that never reached great heights.</p>
                <p>Around 93,000 predominantly Indian fans sat mostly in deathly silence as the home team, who had won 10 matches in a row to make the final, succumbed to their first loss of the tournament in the all-important summit clash.</p>
                <p>Earlier, Pat Cummins's decision to field, primarily to avoid operating with a dewy ball in the night, bemused many but Australian bowlers, aided by some superb fielding, stifled their opposition.
                </p>
                <p>India captain Rohit Sharma had been playing tone-setting knocks in their batting template in the tournament and it was no different in the final despite the early loss of Shubman Gill.</p>
                <p>
                    The opener stepped out against Glenn Maxwell but miscued his shot on the offside. Head ran backwards from cover to take a tumbling catch to get rid of the India captain.Kohli (54) hit Mitchell Starc (3-55) for three boundaries in a row but India slumped to 81-3 in the 11th over when Cummins dismissed Shreyas Iyer caught behind.Kohli and Rahul (66) then combined in a dour rebuilding job even if it meant going 16.1 overs without a boundary.Kohli brought up his ninth 50-plus knock in 11 innings but soon departed after chopping a Cummins delivery on to his stumps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rahul hit just one four in his half-century illustrating how difficult the pitch was for shot-makers like him.Australia wicketkeeper Josh Inglis took five catches, which is a record in a World Cup final.Australia, when they came out to bat, slumped to 47-3 seven overs into what had looked like a straight-forward chase for them.Head combined with Marnus Labuschagne, who made 58 not out, in a 192-run stand to kill off the contest.
