                The FIA announced on Thursday that it had dropped an investigation into Susie and Toto Wolff after finding F1's compliance rules to be sufficiently robust to prevent any breaches of confidentiality; Mercedes say they are in "active legal exchange with the FIA" regarding the situation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Susie Wolff has hit out at the FIA after Formula 1's governing body launched and then dropped an investigation into the F1 Academy managing director and her husband, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff, over an alleged breach of confidentiality.
            </p>
                <p>Shortly after Susie Wolff released a strongly worded statement on Friday, Toto Wolff said that he would not be "commenting officially for now" as Mercedes are in "active legal exchange with the FIA" regarding the situation.</p>
                <p>The FIA announced on Thursday that it had dropped an investigation into the Wolffs after finding Formula 1's compliance rules to be sufficiently robust to prevent any breaches of confidentiality.</p>
                <p>The move came 48 hours after the FIA announced its compliance department was looking into allegations against the Wolffs, and 24 hours after Mercedes' nine rival teams united in coordinated social media posts to deny making any complaints about them.
                </p>
                <p>Reacting to the FIA's statements, neither of which named the parties involved, Wolff appeared to question why she had not received an apology from the organisation.</p>
                <p>
                    In a statement shared on social media, Wolff said: "When I saw the statement issued by the FIA yesterday evening, my first reaction was: 'Is that it?'"For two days, insinuations have been made about my integrity in public and through background briefings, but nobody from the FIA has spoken to me directly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I might have been collateral damage in an unsuccessful attack on somebody else, or the target of a failed attempt to discredit me personally, but I have worked too hard to have my reputation called into question by an unfounded press release."Mercedes and Formula 1, who Wolff works for in her capacity as the managing director of the all-female F1 Academy series, had reacted angrily on Tuesday night to what they described as baseless allegations against the pair and the fact the FIA had not notified them of the investigation prior to releasing a statement to the media.
